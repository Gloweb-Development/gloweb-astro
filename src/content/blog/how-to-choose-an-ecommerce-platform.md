			Global online shopping sales are expected to exceed 6.3 trillion USD by 2024. No matter what you are selling, starting an eCommerce business is a quick and easy way to make a profit. Based on
			this data, now is a great time to start selling online to promote your products and services.
		</p>
		<p class="mb-6">Besides development and operation, there are other factors you need to consider when selecting your eCommerce platform.</p>
		<h1 class="font-extrabold text-xl md:text-2xl lg:text-3xl mb-6">1. Provider's Experience and Expertise</h1>
		php Copy code
		<p class="mb-6">
			Check if the provider truly has the established experience and technical skills to meet the needs and complexities of your requirements, and if they have the knowledge and experience to work
			with your industry.
		</p>
		<p class="mb-6">Take the time to research case studies, client reviews, and forums to see if the provider is well-equipped to handle more than just development.</p>
		<h1 class="font-extrabold text-xl md:text-2xl lg:text-3xl mb-6">2. Support</h1>
		<p class="mb-6">
			When things go wrong—and believe us, things can go wrong—will the provider offer the necessary support to help you solve the problem? Always look for providers who offer 24/7 emergency support
			and can be contacted through various channels, including email, web chat, and phone.
		</p>
		<h1 class="font-extrabold text-xl md:text-2xl lg:text-3xl mb-6">3. Scalability</h1>
		<p class="mb-6">
			As your business grows, your eCommerce platform should grow with it. Your eCommerce platform is the core of your online business. A platform that is difficult to scale can hinder your business
			growth. In our article on
			<a href="/top-5-platforme-ecommerce" class="link">top eCommerce solutions</a>
			for small and medium-sized online businesses, you can find certain details to help you identify the right eCommerce solution based on your needs.
		</p>
		<h1 class="font-extrabold text-xl md:text-2xl lg:text-3xl mb-6">4. SEO Friendliness</h1>
		<p class="mb-6">
			eCommerce platforms that come with comprehensive SEO features will allow your eCommerce site to rank highly in search engine results. Important factors to consider when looking for an
			SEO-friendly eCommerce platform include:
		</p>
		<ul class="mb-6">
			<li>Adding a blog</li>
			<li>Using your own domain</li>
			<li>Facilitating reviews</li>
			<li>Internationalization (Translation into multiple languages)</li>
		</ul>
		<h1 class="font-extrabold text-xl md:text-2xl lg:text-3xl mb-6">5. Responsive Frontend - Proper Display on Mobile Devices</h1>
		<p class="mb-6">
			A mobile-friendly platform is a must. A report from BigCommerce predicts that mobile commerce in Germany, the US, and the UK will account for one-third of all retail eCommerce sales.
		</p>
		<h1 class="font-extrabold text-xl md:text-2xl lg:text-3xl mb-6">6. Security</h1>
		<p class="mb-6">
			Perhaps the most important consideration is security. Since eCommerce is a digital platform that actively takes financial payments, you need to ensure that the eCommerce platform you use has the
			necessary security protocols.
		</p>
		<h1 class="font-extrabold text-xl md:text-2xl lg:text-3xl mb-6">Conclusion</h1>
		<p class="mb-6">
			You need to choose a platform based not only on current needs but also considering scalability and future needs. It is also a good idea to consider available resources—time, human resources, and
			how they can be scaled according to the changing requirements of your online business.
