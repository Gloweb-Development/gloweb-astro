<p class="mb-12">
	In 2019, 80% of people researched companies online before visiting or making a purchase, and the same percentage of customers could be lost due to small businesses without a website. An online
	presence for a business, regardless of industry, can have a massive impact on its success. Nowadays, some companies still don't realize that most of their customers will visit their website before
	making a purchase. If you're not convinced yet and are curious about the advantages of websites over social media profiles, read on! Here are the seven main reasons why you need a website in 2022.
</p>
<br />
<br />

<h1 class="font-extrabold text-xl md:text-2xl lg:text-3xl mb-6">1. Credibility</h1>
<p class="mb-12">
	<strong>84% of today's consumers believe that a website makes your business more credible</strong>
	than companies that only have social media profiles. Most people don't trust a business without a good website. A clean, modern page that is regularly updated and appears in search engines is an
	instant credibility boost. Potential customers will have more trust in you and have all the information they need in one place. In a digital era, we expect businesses to have a web presence.
</p>

<h1 class="font-extrabold text-xl md:text-2xl lg:text-3xl mb-6">2. Opportunities</h1>
<p class="mb-12">
	Perhaps one of the most exciting reasons to have a website for your business is that it can increase your chances of getting potential customers. Once people find you online, become interested in
	your product or service, and want to learn more, they will know how to contact you thanks to the information on your website, giving you the opportunity to increase your sales. Even though websites
	have a cost, when used correctly, they have a positive ROI.
</p>

<h1 class="font-extrabold text-xl md:text-2xl lg:text-3xl mb-6">3. Organic Traffic</h1>
<p class="mb-12">
	Once you are online and have a website optimized for SEO, you have a chance to appear in Google search results. This means that when people search for a product or service, there is a chance that
	your website will appear in the results. This gives you the opportunity to drastically increase your customer base.
</p>

<h1 class="font-extrabold text-xl md:text-2xl lg:text-3xl mb-6">4. Time Savings + Customer Support</h1>
<p class="mb-12">
	Many companies receive calls from potential or existing customers asking simple questions about location and hours of operation. If you miss a call, the customer is left dissatisfied. Calls can
	distract your staff from focusing on the most important parts of your business. A website can reduce these calls and increase internal productivity. At the same time, it helps customers find useful
	information without needing to call, ultimately providing a better user experience.
</p>

<h1 class="font-extrabold text-xl md:text-2xl lg:text-3xl mb-6">5. Digital Marketing</h1>
<p class="mb-12">
	If you plan to use digital marketing to grow your leads and develop your business, you will likely want to drive traffic to a website or landing page. To do this effectively, leverage the historical
	traffic that has come to your website so that you can target the most qualified customers and get the best ROI on your ad spend. This is something that cannot be set up retroactively, so it's best
	to get your website running sooner, even if you don't plan to run ads at this time.
</p>

<p class="mb-12">Websites have become essential for businesses today. We recommend creating one if you haven't already. You can improve it over time, but the key is to start.</p>
